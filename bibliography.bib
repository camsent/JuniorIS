  annote     = {This article explores the intersection of Christianity and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Design. It discusses the need for HCI Designers to consider the spiritual and ethical implications of their work, and how designs capture and keep users' attention. The authors introduce ways that technology can take away from humans relationships with God and others. They claim that a relationship with God involves slowing down, pausing, and being present, which is often at odds with the fast-paced nature of technology. Of course, relationships with others are also important, and the article discusses how technology can both help and hinder these relationships. The authors suggest that HCI Designers can focus on creating technology that encourages mindfullness, presence, and deeper connections with God and others by prioritizing relationship centric design principles. This article interests me because it talks about how technology has negatively impacted our relationship with God and others, and how HCI Designers can help to mitigate these effects through thoughtful design.}

  abstract  = {Since the COVID-19 pandemics, we have witnessed an increase in online worship services. Nevertheless, HCI has little insight into how technological mediation influences religious experiences and how technology should be designed for use in religious contexts. Therefore, we see a unique opportunity to understand better real-world experiences of technology use in religious rituals and, more specifically, in online worship services. Inspired by contextual design, We virtually observed and interviewed eight persons during and after participation in online worship services. We identified a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. The data suggests that current online worship service systems do not account for believers’ needs for community, faith, or extraordinariness. We discuss opportunities for future research and design, and aim to contribute to the understanding of online worship service experiences and the design of technology-mediated religious experiences.},

The study takes place in Germany, which saw a 61% increase in pastors making use of online worship services during the pandemic. The authors conducted virtual observations and interviews with eight particpants to understand how technology mediates religious experiences. They found that believers live in a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. One participant stated that the experience of a worship service is weakend by the online format, and suggested that a lot of the elements leaned more towards infotainment rather than a worship experience. Another participant expressed their disapproval of the focus on production quality instead of content. Overall, this study suggests that online worship services often fail to meet the needs of believers. This paper is interesting to me because it highlights the challenges of using technology to facilitate religious experiences.}

  annote  = {This paper explores the dual nature of technology's impact on Christianity, examining both its positive contributions and potential drawbacks. It discusses how technology has facilitated the spread of Christian teachings and community building, while also raising concerns about distractions and superficial engagement with faith called, "Cultural Christianity." The Author starts by telling a story about his experience at a church with over 4000 members. At the end of the service, on the way back to his car, someone says to him, "That was quite a production this morning, wasn't it?". This comment highlights one of the many problems the church has run into with the use of technology. While the paper makes readers aware of how technology has benefited the church, like making the Gospel more accessible to everyone, it also talks about how the use of technology has watered down the message of Christianity. I like this paper because it gives a balanced view of how technology can both help and hurt Christianity, giving points for both sides which could be useful for me to explain in my research.}

They first go into their formative work phases. First they focused on understanding different dimensions of participant church experiences. After that they engaged participants in the design of the preliminary concepts for the app. They talked about the outcomes of the focus groups and said that they found a fundamental relationship between health, community, and spirituality for church members. They then go into some of the features that their focus groups ended up coming up with. Two that the article highlights are, "Scriptural Reflections", and, "Bible Story of the Day". Another one that the article talks about is called the, "Prayer Wall". This article is useful to me because it discusses examples of what's out there when it comes to apps that are in the genre of spirituality. They're often content based, and they're more useful when you engage with them more. I will be able to talk about examples like this to explain the purpose of my research and how it differs from the majority of spirituality apps.}

It's based on a dissertation written by Finney and chaired by Malony at Fuller Seminary, a famous seminary school in California. The paper starts by defining prayer and then it categorizes prayer into two different types, Prophetic, or Verbal, and Mystical, or Contemplative, prayer. Mystical Prayer is characterized by silent attentiveness to God and Prophetic Prayer is said to be a spontaneous expression of emotion. They move into empirical studies on prayer by looking at different motivations for praying and the effects of Verbal and Contemplative prayer. This paper will be useful to me because it talks about one of the most important spiritual disciplines for a Christian, Prayer. It even breaks it into the different types, which is important because being silent and offering complete attentiveness to a invisible deity is extremely challening.}
