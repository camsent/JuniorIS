  annote     = {This article explores the intersection of Christianity and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Design. It discusses the need for HCI Designers to consider the spiritual and ethical implications of their work, and how designs capture and keep users' attention. The authors introduce ways that technology can take away from humans relationships with God and others. They claim that a relationship with God involves slowing down, pausing, and being present, which is often at odds with the fast-paced nature of technology. Of course, relationships with others are also important, and the article discusses how technology can both help and hinder these relationships. The authors suggest that HCI Designers can focus on creating technology that encourages mindfullness, presence, and deeper connections with God and others by prioritizing relationship centric design principles.}

  abstract  = {Since the COVID-19 pandemics, we have witnessed an increase in online worship services. Nevertheless, HCI has little insight into how technological mediation influences religious experiences and how technology should be designed for use in religious contexts. Therefore, we see a unique opportunity to understand better real-world experiences of technology use in religious rituals and, more specifically, in online worship services. Inspired by contextual design, We virtually observed and interviewed eight persons during and after participation in online worship services. We identified a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. The data suggests that current online worship service systems do not account for believers’ needs for community, faith, or extraordinariness. We discuss opportunities for future research and design, and aim to contribute to the understanding of online worship service experiences and the design of technology-mediated religious experiences.},

The study takes place in Germany, which saw a 61% increase in pastors making use of online worship services during the pandemic. The authors conducted virtual observations and interviews with eight particpants to understand how technology mediates religious experiences. They found that believers live in a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. One participant stated that the experience of a worship service is weakend by the online format, and suggested that a lot of the elements leaned more towards infotainment rather than a worship experience. Another participant expressed their disapproval of the focus on production quality instead of content. Overall, this study suggests that online worship services often fail to meet the needs of believers.}
