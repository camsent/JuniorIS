% provided by most web sites that allow you to export citations. The string
% "clrsAlgorithms" is a citation key, and if you were citing the source in a

  annote    = {This is a popular algorithms textbook which is well-cited. In particular, Part VI on graph algorithms will be of interest. Chapter 26 discusses flow networks and introduces commonly used notation. It formally describes the problem of obtaining a maximum flow and its equivalence to obtaining a minimum cut. The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}

  annote     = {This article explores the intersection of Christianity and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Design. It discusses the need for HCI Designers to consider the spiritual and ethical implications of their work, and how designs capture and keep users' attention. The authors introduce ways that technology can take away from humans relationships with God and others. They claim that a relationship with God involves slowing down, pausing, and being present, which is often at odds with the fast-paced nature of technology. Of course, relationships with others are also important, and the article discusses how technology can both help and hinder these relationships. The authors suggest that HCI Designers can focus on creating technology that encourages mindfullness, presence, and deeper connections with God and others by prioritizing relationship centric design principles.}
