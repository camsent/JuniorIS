\maketitle

In a world where technology is the most accessible it's ever been, sitting still has become next to impossible. Books are being replaced by e-readers, physical stores are being replaced by online shopping, and in-person communication is being replaced ny social media, texting, and video calls. With this rapid advancement in technology, it is important to take time to slow down, get off our devices, connect with others, and with God. Technology has a way of intruding on our daily lives and detracting from activities like pausing, reflecting, praying, and engaging in meaningful conversations[1].

My project aims to create a mobile application that encourages users to take breaks from their devices and engage in meaningful activities that promote mental well-being and spiritual growth. 

In your proposal, you will provide justification on why your project matters based on work which has been done in this area, using in-line citations~\cite{clrsAlgorithms} to refer to existing works. Include what your project will accomplish and how your software will function. 

When you use an image, such as in Figure~\ref{fig:method}, refer to it in the text.
